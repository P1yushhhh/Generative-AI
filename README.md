# LangChain Learning Journey 🦜⛓️

Welcome to my comprehensive guide through learning **LangChain** - a powerful framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs). This repository documents my hands-on exploration of LangChain's capabilities, from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as both a **learning resource** and a **practical guide** for anyone interested in mastering LangChain. Each section contains detailed examples, code implementations, and explanations that helped me understanding the framework from scratch.


## 🗂️ Repository Index

### **Core Concepts**
- **01. Langchain Models** - Working with different language models
- **02. Prompts** - Crafting effective prompts and templates
- **03. Structured Output** - Improve Readability of your output programmaticaly
- **04. Output Parser** - Convert Raw LLM into structured formats

### **Advanced Features**
- **05. Chains** - Building and customizing LangChain chains
- **06. Runnables** - Creating Complex chains with core Langchain Components for complex tasks
- **07. Document Loaders** - Loading docs from various folder into a standard format
- **08. Text Splitter** - Text splitting of large chunks into smaller manageable chunks
- **09. Vector Database** - Working with embeddings, vector storage and similarity search
